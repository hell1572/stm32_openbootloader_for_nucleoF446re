Open bootloader: https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32-mw-openbl

This bootloader sw only uses USART protocol. I have made it work using the STM32CubeProgrammer.
Worked to upload an app and jumping to it. Not to much. 

I didnt found any other openbooloader sw for the NUCLEO F446RE, So i hope this can be helpful for you.
